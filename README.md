- **`Project Name`**: Diane Sanchez
- **`Description`**: A voice in your ears that will intermittently voice your actions to you and tell you how bad you are.
- **`Installation`**: A little later
- **`Usage`**: A little later
- **`Functions`**: Until I get access to a good chat bot API, it will just be a boilerplate 'voice assistant' if you can call it that.
In the future I plan to take this to a larger scale and make a handy assistant without an app, using Rick's wife as a base.
- **`Configurations`**: A little later
- **`Requirements`**: For correct operation, install all the required libraries, this can be done like this ```pip install requirements``` It should also be useful to you [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
### Windows
1. Download assembly from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Unpack the archive and add the path to `ffmpeg` to the `PATH` environment variable, or watch the video tutorial, it will take 3 minutes.
